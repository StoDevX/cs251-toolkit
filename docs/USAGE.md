# Usage

This toolkit gives you the power to do a bunch of things, including

- simply manage a set of student repositories (`stograde repo ...`)
- check which assignments the students have turned in (`stograde table`)
- run tests against those assignments and produce a log file for grading (`stograde record`)
- view programs one at a time in the SD_app React app (`stograde web`)
- check a student's submissions as part of an automatic GitLab CI job (`stograde ci`)
